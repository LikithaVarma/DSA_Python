Problem Description You are given N positive integers.
 For each given integer A, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.
 Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
 Problem Constraints 1 <= N <= 10 1 <= A <= 106 Input Format First line of the input contains a single integer N.
 Each of the next N lines contains a single integer A.
 Output Format In a seperate line, print YES if a given integer is perfect, else print NO.
 Example Input Input 1:
 2
 4
 6
 Input 2:
 1
 3
 Example Output Output 1:
 NO
 YES
 Output 2:
 NO
 Example Explanation Explanation 1: For A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
 For A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
 Explanation 2: For A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3
