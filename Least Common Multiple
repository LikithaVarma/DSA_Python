Problem Description You are given two non-negative integers, A and B. Find the value of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of A and B.
 LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both.
 Problem Constraints 1 <= A, B <= 1000 Input Format The first argument is an integer A.
 The second argument is an integer B.
 Output Format Return an integer.
 Example Input Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 3
 Input 2:
 A = 9
 B = 6
 Input 3:
 A = 2
 B = 6
 Example Output Output 1:
 6
 Input 2:
 18
 Input 3:
 6
 Example Explanation Explanation 1: 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
 Explanation 2: 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
 Explanation 3: 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).
 
 class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def LCM(self, A, B):
        ans=0
        n=min(A,B)
        #return n
        while n<=A*B:
            if (n%A==0 and n%B==0):
                ans=n
                break
            n+=1
        return ans
